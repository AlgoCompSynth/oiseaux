## Goals

The goal of the `oiseaux` package [@borasky2022a] is to provide tools for
composers to manipulate bird calls for incorporation into musical 
compositions. `oiseaux` imports sound file download tools from `warbleR` [@araya_salas2017] and analysis / synthesis tools from `soundgen`
[@anikin2019].

In this vignette, we demonstrate `oiseaux` by creating a strange bird from
two well-known birds that are active at night in North America: the great horned owl (Bubo sss) and the common loon (). The resulting night creature is
called the _owloon_.
